  abstract       = {A generalized method for analyzing the effects of
                   multiple drugs and for determining summation, synergism
                   and antagonism has been proposed. The derived,
                   generalized equations are based on kinetic principles.
                   The method is relatively simple and is not limited by
                   whether the dose-effect relationships are hyperbolic or
                   sigmoidal, whether the effects of the drugs are
                   mutually exclusive or nonexclusive, whether the ligand
                   interactions are competitive, noncompetitive or
                   uncompetitive, whether the drugs are agonists or
                   antagonists, or the number of drugs involved. The
                   equations for the two most widely used methods for
                   analyzing synergism, antagonism and summation of
                   effects of multiple drugs, the isobologram and
                   fractional product concepts, have been derived and been
                   shown to have limitations in their applications. These
                   two methods cannot be used indiscriminately. The
                   equations underlying these two methods can be derived
                   from a more generalized equation previously developed
                   by us (59). It can be shown that the isobologram is
                   valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually
                   exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is
                   valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have
                   hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the
                   isobol method, it is laborious to find proper
                   combinations of drugs that would produce an
                   iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method
                   tends to give indication of synergism, since it
                   underestimates the summation of the effect of mutually
                   nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect
                   curves. The method described herein is devoid of these
                   deficiencies and limitations. The simplified
                   experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect
                   analysis has the following advantages: It provides a
                   simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot)
                   for evaluating the applicability of the data, and
                   provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain
                   a general equation for the dose-effect relation; the
                   analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and
                   linear regression can be readily carried out with a
                   simple programmable electronic calculator and does not
                   require special graph paper or tables; and the
                   simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of
                   application and the use of a minimum number of data
                   points. This method has been used to analyze
                   experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and
                   animal systems.},

                   models in order to find optimal combinations yielding
                   the highest antitumor activity. The concept of
                   synergism is not clearly established in vivo because of
                   the necessity of considering both the antitumor
                   activity, the toxicity and often the occurrence of
                   unexpected side-effects. In vitro, several concepts

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Safer and more effective mixtures of
                   anticancer drugs are needed, and modeling can assist in
                   this endeavor. This paper describes classification
                   models that were constructed to predict which
                   fixed-ratio mixtures created from a pool of 10 drugs
                   would show a high degree of in-vitro synergism against
                   H460 human lung cancer cells. One of the tested drugs
                   was doxorubicin and the others were natural compounds
                   including quercetin, curcumin, and EGCG. Explanatory
                   variables were based on virtual docking profiles.
                   Docking profiles for the 10 drugs were obtained for
                   1087 proteins using commercial docking software. The
                   cytotoxicity of all 10 drugs and of 45 of the 1,013
                   possible mixtures was tested in the laboratory and
                   synergism indices were generated using the MixLow
                   method. Model accuracy was assessed using cross
                   validation, as well as using predictions on a new set
                   of 10 tested mixtures. Results were compared to models
                   where explanatory variables were constructed using the
                   pseudomolecule approach of Sheridan. RESULTS: On this
                   data set, the pseudomolecule and docking data approach
                   produce models of similar accuracy. Leave-one-out
                   precision for the negative (highly synergistic) class
                   and the positive (low- or non-synergistic) class was
                   0.73 and 0.80, respectively. Precision for a
                   nonstandard leave-many-out cross validation procedure
                   was 0.60 and 0.77 for the negative and positive
                   classes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Useful
                   classification models can be constructed to predict
                   drug synergism, even in those situations where a
                   limited subset of component drugs can be tested.
                   Compared to the pseudomolecule approach, the virtual
                   docking approach has the advantage of greater potential
                   for biologic interpretation. This distinction may
                   become important as virtual docking software becomes
                   more accurate and docking results more closely resemble
                   actual binding affinities. This is the first published
                   report of a model designed to predict the degree of
                   in-vitro synergism based on the pseudomolecule or
                   docking data approach.},

  abstract       = {Cancer drugs are commonly administered in the clinic
                   in the form of mixtures, also called cocktails or
                   combinations. Assessment of synergistic and
                   antagonistic interactions between drugs is therefore an
                   important aspect of cancer research. Numerous methods
                   have been proposed to assess drug interactions, each
                   one based on a null (or additive) model. In this paper,
                   the Loewe additivity index is used as a basis.
                   Parameters of concentration-response curves, used as
                   input to the Loewe equation, are estimated with a
                   nonlinear mixed-effects model. The use of a nonlinear
                   mixed-effects model, in combination with the Loewe
                   index and a procedure to calculate confidence intervals
                   of the index, is referred to as the 'MixLow' method.
                   Simulations of a sham mixture of a drug with itself
                   show that the MixLow method provides parameter
                   estimators that are more precise than those produced by
                   the Median-Effect method, a popular approach that uses
                   log linearization of the concentration-response curves.
                   Coverage of confidence intervals for the interaction
                   index is acceptable for the MixLow method but poor for
                   the Median-Effect method. This is the first comparison
                   report of coverage of confidence intervals for the
                   Loewe interaction index. A mixture of vincristine and
                   topotecan is also analyzed by the MixLow method and the
                   results are compared with those previously published.
                   The MixLow method can be used to quantify drug
                   interactions in any fixed-ratio drug combination study
                   that includes within-group and between-group
                   replicates, and where responses follow a sigmoidal
                   pattern. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, generalized linear and nonlinear
                   mixed-effects models have proved to be powerful tools
                   for the analysis of unbalanced longitudinal data. To
                   date, much of the work has focused on various methods
                   for estimating and comparing the parameters of
                   mixed-effects models. Very little work has been done in
                   the area of model selection and goodness-of-fit,
                   particularly with respect to the assumed
                   variance-covariance structure. In this paper, we
                   present a goodness-of-fit statistic which can be used
                   in a manner similar to the R2 criterion in linear
                   regression for assessing the adequacy of an assumed
                   mean and variance-covariance structure. In addition, we
                   introduce an approximate pseudo-likelihood ratio test
                   for testing the adequacy of the hypothesized
                   convariance structure. These methods are illustrated
                   and compared to the usual normal theory likelihood
                   methods (Akaike's information criterion and the
                   likelihood ratio test) using three examples. Simulation
                   results indicate the pseudo-likelihood ratio test
                   compares favorably with the standard normal theory
                   likelihood ratio test, but both procedures are
                   sensitive to departures from normality.},

  abstract       = {Two drugs that produce overtly similar effects will
                   sometimes produce exaggerated or diminished effects
                   when used concurrently. A quantitative assessment is
                   necessary to distinguish these cases from simply
                   additive action. This distinction is based on the
                   classic pharmacologic definition of additivity that,
                   briefly stated, means that each constituent contributes
                   to the effect in accord with its own potency.
                   Accordingly, the relative potency of the agents, not
                   necessarily constant at all effect levels, allows a
                   calculation using dose pairs to determine the
                   equivalent of either agent and the effect by using the
                   equivalent in the dose-response relation of the
                   reference compound. The calculation is aided by a
                   popular graph (isobologram) that provides a visual
                   assessment of the interaction but also requires
                   independent statistical analysis. The latter can be
                   accomplished from calculations that use the total dose
                   in a fixed-ratio combination along with the calculated
                   additive total dose for the same effect. Different
                   methods may be used, and each is applicable to
                   experiments in which a single drug is given at two
                   different sites. When departures from additivity are
                   found, whether in "two-drug" or "two-site" experiments,
                   the information is useful in designing new experiments
                   for illuminating mechanisms. Several examples, mainly
                   from analgesic drug studies, illustrate this
                   application. Even when a single drug (or site) is used,
                   its introduction places it in potential contact with a
                   myriad of chemicals already in the system, a fact that
                   underscores the importance of this topic in other areas
                   of biological investigation.},
